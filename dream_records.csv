3,"I was trapped in a never-ending corridor of mirrors. Each reflection showed a different version of myself, but with eyes that were completely black. As I ran, the reflections began to shatter, revealing dark, foggy silhouettes that started to move towards me. I tried to scream, but my voice was muffled by the sound of my own echoes, whispering ""you're next"" over and over.",Negative,,,-0.0194444444444444,0.3055555555555555
4,"I was driving a car on a deserted highway at night, but the GPS kept redirecting me in circles. Suddenly, the radio crackled to life, and a voice whispered my name. I slammed on the brakes, and the car skidded to a stop. That's when I saw it: a figure in the backseat, staring at me with cold, calculating eyes. As I tried to escape, the car doors locked, and the figure began to whisper a chilling phrase: ""You'll never leave this place."" The car's headlights flickered, and I was plunged into darkness, with the sound of my own screams echoing through the night.",Negative,,,-0.175,0.7
5,"Just as the ghost was about to reach out and grab me, I heard a loud noise behind it. The ghost turned around, and I saw a group of adventurers entering the temple. They were armed with torches and spears, and they looked like they were ready to take on anything. The ghost let out a blood-curdling scream and disappeared into thin air. The adventurers turned to me and said, ""Come on, we have to get out of here. The temple is cursed, and we don't have much time."" I didn't need to be told twice, so I followed them out of the temple and back to the boat. As we sailed away from the island, I looked back and saw the temple collapsing into the sea. I felt a sense of relief wash over me, knowing that I had escaped the horror of the island. But as I turned to the adventurers, I saw that they were all smiling at me. ""That was just the beginning,"" one of them said. ""The real adventure is just starting."" And with that, the dream faded to black.",Positive,,,-0.02666666666666666,0.38833333333333336
